The monster’s eyes pierced through the dark. The gnashing sounds of his chewing was the only thing audible in the cave. Arryn hid behind a long grouping of stalagmites, making sure that his breathing was as low as he could make it. He looked over at Radha, his friend who was now a pile of gore and blood. The torch by Radha’s head showed the slash marks in his chest and revealed his missing leg. A leg that was now being by the monster a few feet away.

Arryn wondered what path had led them down this. He wished that they had listened to all of those who warned them to stay away from the cave. Arryn began to move down the row of stalagmites. The sounds of the chewing allowed him to move with little worry of being heard. His legs quivered with each step. He knew that if he were to trip, it would mean the end of him. He walked a good ten feet before he finally saw the light coming from the cave entrance. Unfortunately, he would have to leave the safety of the stalagmite row in order to leave the cave.

Arryn looked around, hoping to find something that would allow him to escape. He noticed an old pickaxe leaned up against a boulder near the entrance. The pickaxe would offer him some means to defend himself, but wouldn’t allow him to leave in peace. Just then, he noticed a rock near his foot. He reached down and picked it up. He looked over to Radha’s body and launched the rock as far past it as he could. He heard the monster stop chewing. The monster sniffed and then followed the sound. With his heart pounding, Arryn inched forward. He took two steps and then heard a shriek. The beating of the monster’s feet grew louder each second. Arryn looked and the pickaxe and took a deep breath. The monster’s steps nearing closer and closer. Arryn moved without thinking and found himself right back behind the stalagmite.

Arryn looked over towards Radha and found that his body was missing. It appeared to him that monster had simply returned to secure his meal. Arryn slowed his breath and then looked around for another rock. He found one and quickly got it ready. He felt that, if he was fast enough, he would be able to exit the cave and that the monster would leave him alone. For the monster already had a meal and was never mentioned to go out of the cave. Arryn brought the rock up behind his head. He looked over in the direction of the monster and found only a dim ember where the torch used to be. He took a deep breath and hurled the rock in that direction.

Seconds later, he heard the rock hit the wall and then monster stop eating. He waited until the monster had shuffled a bit before started to move. After the monster’s steps had before a faint whisper, he started to move quickly forward. The entrance was now only about 20 feet away. Arryn moved closer towards the exit but stumbled on a large rock. As soon as he hit the ground, he could hear the monster shriek. He looked up and saw the pickaxe only a few feet away. The monster’s shrieks overwhelmed every thought that Arryn had. He ran forward, grabbed the pickaxe, and then stumbled his way towards the entrance. The monsters footsteps were now directly behind him. In a panic, Arryn blindly swung the pickaxe around. The monster lurched back in pain as Arryn continued to run. The light of the moon was now more visible than the dark. As a smile started to form across Arryn’s face, he felt his leg get heavy. In that instant, he knew that would join Radha.
