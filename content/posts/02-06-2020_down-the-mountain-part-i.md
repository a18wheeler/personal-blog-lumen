Something strange had happened to me. My hands were bound behind my back and  my head was completely covered. I was disoriented but able to make out the fact that I was in a van. “Hello!” I shouted out. No response. Despite that, I could feel that I wasn’t alone in the van. “What are you going to do with me?” I asked. Again, I was greeted with silence.

Since I wasn’t getting anything out of my fellow passengers, I tried to pull in what information I could. The incessant rocking let me know that we were off-road and the way that head was pulling told me that we were going uphill. There was a little opening near the bottom of the hood that allowed me to see a little light and my feet. Other than that, I had no idea what was going on. I began to tug on the rope that bound my hands but there was very little give. The reality of the situation began to wear on me and I started to feel very hot. I calmed my breath and tried again. This time, there was a little more give. I leaned back further until I could feel the back of the van. Then I slid my hands down in order to prevent them from being spotted. 

I started to tug on the rope again. The more I worked at it, the more I could feel the tension loosening on my hands. I tried to keep my breath low and steady, to avoid any suspicion. I could almost slip my right hand out of the rope when a hand was suddenly on my shoulder. The hand pushed me down and I felt the rope tighten up again. “You better save your energy” whispered the voice. I sat back and tried to think about what I could do next. Before I could think of anything else, the van came to a stop.

Suddenly, the van doors opened. The moonlight pierced through the hood. Through the hood, I saw the outline of three men leaving the van. A fourth man pulled at me and led me towards the exit. He walked me about twenty feet before stopping. I could feel his breath in my ear as he moved closer to me. “Don’t move, or you die” he said. I felt him tug at the rope and then place something in my pocket. Then, all of a sudden, he began to pull back. I could hear his footsteps as he walked away. Then the van doors opened. Then they closed. I heard the van drive away and then I heard nothing. Not even a bird chirping. The only sound that remained was the sound of the wind whipping in the night. I took this time to try and work at the rope again. Surprisingly, it was coming apart very quickly. I tugged at it again and could feel that it was about to snap. 

Then the hair on my neck pricked up. Something was moving behind me. The footsteps were much louder than the man’s feet earlier. Everything in my body was shouting to escape but I found that I couldn’t move. The footsteps were now so close that I could feel the small rocks shake around my feet. I suddenly gained movement again and began to pull on the rope. With one more pull, I would be free, I knew it. Suddenly, the creature was behind me. I could feel it’s breath on my neck. I pulled at the rope again and felt it break. I quickly removed my hood and found myself at the edge of a cliff. With my body still shaking, I turned around and looked straight into the eyes of the beast. It started with vicious intent and let out a ferocious roar. I stumbled back and lost my footing. Suddenly, I was falling. Falling far into the abyss with a monster looking down on me.
