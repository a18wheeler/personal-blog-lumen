The writer was quite happy with the progress of his story. So happy in fact, that he decided to call his dog over and have him share in his happiness. "Hey Pizza, you doing good?" the writer asked. Pizza instantly understood this and wagged his tail faster as a show of understanding. The writer then asked for a high five, to which Pizza complied. The writer was very happy that he had taught Pizza this trick. It was a trick that didn't even take long for Pizza to learn. This made the writer wonder what else he could teach Pizza. So he began to look up easier tricks that he could teach the dog. His dream trick to teach would be to 'Play Dead Once Shot', however, this would most likely be too difficult for Pizza to learn. Instead, he chose to teach Pizza how to shake his hand. He grabbed a box of treats and walked over to Pizza. Pizza sat, anxiously waiting for the inevitable treat. "Shake," the writer began. 

He then grabbed the pup's paw and shook it up and down. The dog tucked it's ears back and licked his owners hand. "No, no licking Pizza," the writer scolded. "Shake," he said again. He grabbed Pizza's paw again and shook it. To his surprise, the pup did not lick his hand. The writer felt that he was close to success and gave the dog a treat. He pulled out another treat and declared, "Let's do it on the first try." He reached out towards Pizza and said "Shake". The dog looked into his owner's eye as if they had a complete understanding of each other. The dog leaned forward and then licked the writer's hand. "What? No!" the writer exclaimed. "No treat until you do the trick". Pizza's eye's had determination and this was something that the writer knew. "Let's try this again."

The writer them reverted to his previous tactic of saying "Shake" and then taking the dog's paw in hand. He did this seven times until he felt that Pizza was ready to do the trick. "This time," he said. "This time we got this." Pizza sat with eyes focused purely on the treat. The writer took a deep breath. His palms were sweating as he uttered those final words, "Shake". Pizza opened his mouth and leaned forward. His eyes were shinning as he rose his paw. The writer's excitement grew as the Pizza's paw came towards him. He knew that this was the moment that it would happen. 

Pizza's paw landed right on the writer's hand and the writer began to move it up and down. His smile now matched Pizza's. As he began to praise his pup for it's accomplishment, his hand became wet. He looked back at his hand to find Pizza licking his hand like a fat kid licks his plate on Thanksgiving. A sudden surge of disappointed shadowed the writer. However, he didn't let it outshine this small accomplishment. He handed the treat over to Pizza and watched him gobble it down. "High five?" he asked. Pizza turned and was pleased to give the writer the highest of fives.
