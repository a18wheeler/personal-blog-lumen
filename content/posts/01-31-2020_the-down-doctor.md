The buzzing of the streetlight outside, echoed in Charles’ ear. The sound of the streetlight somehow even overpowered the sound of the music coming from his computer. Had he remembered to get his headphones from Tom, this probably wouldn’t have been an issue. Had he not lived in a cheap apartment with thin walls, he could probably increase the volume on his computer. However, he did leave his headphones behind and he did live in a cheap apartment with thin walls, thus the buzzing rang through his mind. 

He glanced over at the bobble head on his desk. It was a bobble head of the 10th Doctor from Doctor Who. “You would never have had to deal with this, would you?” Charles thought. He smiled as he tapped the bobble head’s head. The swaying of the head seemed to calm him and bring him back to his work. Work that needed to be done yesterday. The buzzing continued to ring in his ear. “We must have something, right?” he asked the bobble head. He then stood up and went to go search his closet. Inside, he found a few hung shirts and a box of clothes that he rarely wore. It was inside this box that he found some earmuffs. “What do you think?” He asked The Doctor. 

He placed the ear muffs on his head and sighed. The buzzing continued. He took off the ear muffs and threw them on the bed. He then went into his bathroom and grabbed a roll of toilet paper. He took a few pieces of toilet paper and stuffed both ears with the material. Still the buzzing rang. His blood boils as the ringing continues. He grinds his teeth and snaps his eyes shut, trying to keep out the noise. Still it rings. Suddenly, the bobble head falls to the ground. Charles removes the paper and looks around. There’s nothing; just the buzzing. Then, the creaking of the door behind can be heard. He spins quickly but finds no one. Still the buzzing rings.

Charles leans forward in his chair, trying to peak out of the door without leaving it. He finally decides to get up and investigate. As he walks forward, the buzzing of the streetlight seems to grow. He begins to sweat as he moves closer. He can feel his heart pounding by the time he reaches the door. He pushes the door the rest of the way open and turns on the light. The light reveals an empty living room. Nothing around. Only the buzzing. Charles then becomes angry and rushes outside. He runs right over to the street light and starts to hit it. This only results in a painful hand. Disgruntled, Charles returns to his room. He sits back in his chair and tries to remain focused on his work. 

Before he can even look at his computer, the door behind him slams shut. He spins around but sees nothing. “Hello?” he calls out. The only sound that is returned is the buzzing of the streetlight. Suddenly a dog starts barking and the buzzing gets louder. Then the door knob on the door starts to rattle back and forth. Charles rolls back into the desk. As the buzzing gets louder, so too does the light from the streetlight. The light grows to be so bright that it is near blinding through the shutters. Charles’ heart feels as if it is going to burst out of it’s chest. Charles screams out for anyone to help. However, the buzzing has become so loud that he cannot even hear himself. Charles shuts his eyes and clasps his hands against his ears. “Help!” he shouts. “HELP! PLEASE HELP!”

Suddenly, there is silence. He opens his eyes and finds himself on his bed. The buzzing of the streetlight remaining but being even quieter than before. He takes three deep breathes and then hops out of bed. He looks down and finds himself still dressed. “Was it all a dream?” he thinks. Charles then looks over at his desk and sees the time on his laptop. He grabs the laptop and rushes outside so that he can get to the bus in time. As he grabs the laptop, he knocks over a pencil. The pencil rolls off the left side of the desk and lands right next to the Doctor Who bobble head. The only other witness of that night.
