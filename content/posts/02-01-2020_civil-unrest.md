Mary was surprised when she heard knocking at her front door. It was late in the night and not many people would dare to venture outside of their homes with a battle going on only a few miles away. She cautiously moved towards the bolted door. As she neared the door, the door shook. A man on the other side began to bang it loudly.

"Open up the door! Please! It's an emergency!" the man cried out. 

Mary reluctantly opened the door and was greeted with a gun to her face.

"Who else is in the house ma'am?" the man asked.

Mary could now see that this man was a confederate soldier. Dirty and bloodstained from the battle close by. Mary looked behind the armed man and saw another confederate soldier, barely breathing, but still alive. 

"I say again," the man kept his voice low, "who else is in the house?" His words had a sharpness as he spoke. He was patient but very quickly losing his cool demeanor. 

"There's no one else here. It's just me," she responded.

"I hope you're right. I would really hate to have to kill another person today." The man pushed his way forward and glanced around the corners. "Alright, I trust you," he said, now in a normal tone. "Help me get him inside," he said as he motioned towards his comrade. Mary rushed over to the man and helped set him on a nearby couch. The healthy man quickly ran over to the door to close it. He made a quick look out the window before rushing back to the wounded soldier. "What can you do for the man?" he asked. 

"I think I have some upstairs, let me go check," Mary gets up to go but is stopped when the soldier grabs her arm. 

"Remember, don't take advantage of my trust." He stared dead into her eyes. Hours seem to pass before he finally releases her arm. Mary goes upstairs and grabs some alcohol and bandages. She returns downstairs but only finds the wounded soldier. She looks around the room but finds no evidence of him. 

"Glad to see you found something," he whispers from behind. Mary jumps around and finds a gun pointed and her from the dark. 

"What are you doing?" she asked.

"Nothing," he says as he lowers his gun and steps into the light, "I just had to make sure that you weren't trying to set us up. That definitely would have been a mistake." Mary tries to keep her composure and slow her breathing. She turns to the injured soldier and then back to the other. "Go on," he motions with a wave of his hand.  Mary returns to the wounded soldier and starts to tend to his wounds. The man comes over and hovers over her. "What's your name?" he asks.

"Mary" she responds. 

"Well hello Ms. Mary, my name is Bill and this here is Richard."

"Mrs," she says sharply.

"What was that?"

"It's Mrs."

"I thought you said that you were alone," he said tightening the grip on his rifle.

"I am. My husband is dead," she said keeping her composure. 

"Oh," the soldier's grip loosened on the gun, "well my condolences then." 

"Thank you," she said in a terse whisper. "I have stopped the bleeding in his belly but need more bandages to patch it up. Can you hold the bandage here?"

"Sure," Bill replies. Mary again goes upstairs. Bill looks down and Richard and notices that his eyes are closed. "Hey bud, open your eyes. You better stay awake." Richard doesn't move. Bill smacks Richard in the face. Nothing. "Hey, Mrs. Mary! I think Richard is dead!" Tears begin to stem down Bill's face. Suddenly, a click can be heard.

"You're goddamn right he is." Bill turns around and finds Mary behind him with a rifle. A mixture of hate in fear filled her eyes. "My William died because of you bastards," she says with fiery inflection.

"Mrs. Mary," Bill says while raising his hands, "you don't have to do this." Bill glances over at his gun, a few feet away, but only for a second. He knew that a glance lasting a second longer would lead to his death. 

"I want you to know something Bill," Mary started, "you're friend might have survived had I not slipped the bastard some rat poison." Bill's eyes lit up with anger. He instantly reached for the gun and brought it up. A single shot rang out. Bill and Mary both stared deep into each other's eyes. Then slowly, Bill collapsed over next to Richard. His beath shuttering as he moved his hand over his own wound. He looked over at Richard and reached out. His hand collapsed as his final breath left his body and a little patch of flooring became his deathbed; a deathbed a mere inches away from that of his comrade's.
