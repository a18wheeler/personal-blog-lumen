Hi, my name is Andrew Wheeler and I am a Software Engineer by day and an aspiring writer by night.

Since I hope to take off the "aspiring" part one day, I have planned to write a short story every single day outside of weekends. I haven't really set any limitations for myself, I would only say that each story must feel like it has a natural beginning and end. Since I will be writing these stories everyday, you probably won't find a single story much longer than six hundred words long. We'll see.

Hopefully you enjoy some of the stories I write. Who knows, I might even write something good once in a while.
