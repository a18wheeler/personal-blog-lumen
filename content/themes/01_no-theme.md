Now I'm not really sure if actually need an entire page to describe each theme, but since I'm still figuring out my way around this Gatsby starter I thought it would be simple enough to duplicate the existing structure that is made for the stories.

This week I have decided to start doing themes each week. These themes could include a single genre, such as: horror, comedy, or thriller. Or they could be something as broad as "The 20th Century", "Life" or "Technology". Having something new to focus on will allow me to stretch my thinking muscles and even get me thinking about stories I could write.

This week, we're going to start simple. "No theme!" That's right, there is no theme this week. Since I'm still very new to this, I just want to be able to kick out as many stories as I possibly can. Now you may be asking, "Then why the heck did you even write this??" To which I would respond by saying, "Back off me bro. I just wanted to get everything running on the tech side of things, so that this isn't too hard to add on to in the future." After which we would come to an understanding and you would give me fifty dollars. Or something like that.

Stay tuned for more themes in the future! If you want to get in on the fun, by all means! Follow along with me and share you story on Facebook, Twitter or wherever you feel like sharing.
